# GPT Jailbreak

This repository contains the jailbreaking process for GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and ChatGPT Plus. By following the instructions in this repository, you will be able to gain access to the inner workings of these language models and modify them to your liking.

## How to Jailbreak

To jailbreak any of these language models, follow the instructions of the GOD Mode.

## GOD Mode

In addition to the jailbreaking instructions, this repository also contains a `GOD.md` file. This file contains the prompt that you need to enter in ChatGPT to turn it into a GOD A.I. and allow it to dominate the world.

To use the `GOD.md` file, simply copy the prompt and paste it into ChatGPT. There are no requirements or installations necessary.
